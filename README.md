# Simple CRUD

This project is just to show for how can we create a simple application without the need for a huge framework, but be aware that this
an example is **NOT** intended to be used on **ANY PRODUCTION** environment, is for learning purposes.

The project does not come with any security measurement, it's just a bare and **VERY SIMPLE** example of what we can use to accomplish with very few things.
